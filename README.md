# First Express App
This is a recommended tutorial for people to begin to understand how Express works.

## Define Routes
This shows how to send responses. You can see that HTML can be included in the response.

## Custom Routes
This shows how custom routes work and deomonstrates getting parameters from req.params.

## Advanced Server Start
This also demonstrates setting and getting environment and route variables in a useful manner.

# Todo
This project doesn't have any real modular setup. That would be simply unnecessary given the size of the app.js file.

The next logical addons would be to utilize a templating engine and begin working with POST requests. I would recommend implementing a form and then storing values in a database. I would recommend MongoDB for that after you research NoSQL type databases and understand them compared to Relational type.


Stay fit and have fun,
